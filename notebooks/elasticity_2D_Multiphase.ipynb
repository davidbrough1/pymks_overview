    "This example provides a demonstration of using PyMKS to compute the linear strain field for a three phase composite material. It demonstrates how to generate data for delta microstructures and then use this data to calibrate the first order MKS influence coefficients. The calibrated influence coefficients are used to predict the strain response for a random microstructure and the results are compared with those from finite element. Finally, the influence coefficients are scaled up and the MKS results are again compared with the finite element data for a large problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMKS uses the finite element tool [SfePy](http://sfepy.org) to generate both the strain fields to fit the MKS model and the verification data to evaluate the MKS model's accuracy."

    "\n",
    "Note that an inappropriate boundary condition is used in this example because current version of SfePy is unable to implement a periodic plus displacement boundary condition. This leads to some issues near the edges of the domain and introduces errors into the resizing of the coefficients. We are working to fix this issue, but note that the problem is not with the MKS regression itself, but with the calibration data used. The finite element package ABAQUS includes the displaced periodic boundary condition and can be used to calibrate the MKS regression correctly."
