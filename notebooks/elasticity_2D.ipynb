    "This example provides a demonstration of using PyMKS to compute the linear strain field for a two phase composite material. The example introduces the governing equations of linear elasticity along with the unique boundary conditions required for the MKS. It subsequently demonstrates how to generate data for delta microstructures and then use this data to calibrate the first order MKS influence coefficients for all strain fields. The calibrated influence coefficients are used to predict the strain response for a random microstructure and the results are compared with those from finite element. Finally, the influence coefficients are scaled up and the MKS results are again compared\n",
