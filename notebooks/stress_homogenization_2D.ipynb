This example starts with a brief background of the homogenization theory on the components of the effective elastic stiffness tensor for a composite material. Then the example generates random microstructures and their average stress values that will be used to show how to calibrate and use our model. We will also show how to use tools from [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to optimize fit parameters for the MKSHomogenizationModel. Lastly, the data is used to evaluate the MKSHomogenizationModel for effective stiffness values for a new set of microstructures.\n"
